							<h2>Why is entrepreneurship important?</h2>
							<p style="text-align: left">Entrepreneurship is extremely important to Canada and the world at large. Entrepreneurs push the forefront of what is possible, pioneering new technologies to improve our quality of life. Entrepreneurship should be a core strategy of our plan for the future. Fostering entrepreneurship is essential to ensuring humanity's success in the long term, as well as securing the well-being and prosperity of Canada in the short-term. Entrepreneurs are core to economic growth, creating jobs and powering the economy forward. According to the EY Global Job Creation survey (2015), over 50% of entrepreneurs are expected to expand the workforce of their businesses in Canada, compared to just 4% of traditional businesses. Entrepreneurship can even tackle social problems, and attempt to create social change and participate in community development.</p>

							<h2>Why are universities poised to be the next I&amp;E megahubs?</h2>
							<p style="text-align: left">Poised at the intersection of research, development, and industry, universities are uniquely positioned to be powerhouses of entrepreneurship and innovation. Partnerships with industry give students real, hands-on experience with technology and innovation, while cutting-edge research allows the to dream big simultaneously. Universities have the ability to be on the forefront of this new push for I&amp;E, but only if they leverage the unique resources that they have to offer towards this goal. This is where the University Innovation Fellows come in.</p>

							<h2>I don't have the "right stuff"</h2>
							<p style="text-align: left">A reoccurring theme that we encountered interviewing students was the idea of not "having the right stuff". More or less, that entrepreneurship should be left to the business students, that it is too difficult for the 'common student'. This is one misconception that we, as students interested in I&amp;E, feel passionately that we need to correct. Entrepreneurship should be for everyone, whether a arts, science, business, or computer science major. In fact, entrepreneurship is most effective when it incorporats a wide and diverse set of ideas and perspectives.</p>

							<h3>What is University Innovation Fellows?</h3>

							<p>The University Innovation Fellows program empowers students to become leaders of change in higher education.
								<br />
							Fellows are creating a global movement to ensure that all students gain the necessary attitudes, skills and knowledge to compete in the economy of the future. (universityinnovationfellows.org)</p>

									<h2>Round One: Justin and Dhruv</h2>
									<p style="text-align: left">The University Innovation Fellows program began at Dalhousie with fifth-year management student Justin Javorek and Engineering graduate student Dhruv Bhatia. They were the first stduents to be invited to take part in the program outside of the US, as the first international pilot. They founded the D.E.S. (Dalhousie Entrepreneurship Society) and ran the first Hackamarine student hackathon, setting the example for future generations of Fellows at Dal.</p>

									<h2>Round Two: Selin and Yaser</h2>
									<p style="text-align: left">The Second Round of University Innovation Fellows at Dalhousie was spearheaded by Selin Dogan, third-year commerce student originally from Turkey, and Yaser Alkayale, third-year computer science student originally from Syria. They took over the leadership of the D.E.S. from Justin and Dhruv, bringing entrepreneurship and innovation to students across Dalhousie. They were again the only Canadian Fellows in their year. As leaders of the D.E.S., Selin and Dogan rebranded, and extended its reach to over 500 members. As well, they began two new initiatives: #UIFresh, bringing I&amp;E to Orientation Week, and Tuesday Takeoffs, bringing I&amp;E concepts to beginners in the field in a friendly and accessible way.</p>

							<h2>4 Strategies for improving I&amp;E at Dal</h2>

Through the intensive six-week training program, which included through several rounds of iteration and validation, we determined that these were the most important strategic priorities for making I&amp;E at Dalhousie even better.</p>

								<p>Introducing the new generation to I&amp;E</p>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: left">We wish to create of a series of design thinking workshops, introductory entrepreneurship events, pop-up workshops, etc. to bring more beginners into entrepreneurship in a non-intimidating way.</p> 

							<p style="text-align: left">These new events would be run under the D.E.S. (Dalhousie Entrepreneurship Society), with a distinctive pro-beginner introductory spin. On getting a better taste for the startup world, passionate and interested students would “graduate” to full-on LaunchDAL events and startup weekends.</p>

							<header>
								<h2 id="new-brand">Friendly new brand</h2>
								<p>Making promotion more friendly around I&amp;E events</p>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: left">We wish to create a beginner-oriented LaunchDal sub-brand. This new brand will aim to fill the gaps and correct the misconceptions we identified when talking to students (as mentioned in <a href="#right-stuff" class="smooth-scroll-middle">"Right stuff" section</a>). This brand will have more beginner-oriented branding, designed in a more hyperfocused way than the current general LaunchDal branding.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left">Leveraging the existing marketing and promotional networks of the D.E.S., this new brand will be launched as a complement to existing efforts. As part of the more general strategy of improving dissemination of I&amp;E at Dal, we also wish introduce a D.E.S. Facebook group, allowing for a more active D.E.S. online community, that could respond to announcements with feedback and start new discussion threads and ideas.</p>

							<hr>

							<header>
								<h2 id="class-exchange">Class-exchange</h2>
								<p>Giving students cross-deparmental shared experiences</p>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: left">In order to enhance the interaction between students across faculties, we aim to launch a class-exchange system where students can take classes with students from other faculties on a monthly basis.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left">Some specific classes from each faculty would offer up to 10 students per month, to voluntarily take a part in the class. The potential benefit of this system would let students walk into the shoes of others in terms of academic lives of one to another. In addition to that, they can connect and get to know students from variety of faculty for a greater ability to form a diverse team once they decide to take their innovative ideas and start working on it as entrepreneurs.</p>

								<p>Rethinking the Collider: making it into a productive, energizing entrepreneurship space</p>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: left">We wish to transform the Collider into a more entrepreneurship and innovation-oriented space. We will do this by redesigning the room, "theming" it with entrepreneurship and innovation inspirational quotes on the wall, etc.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left">We also wish to have regular walk-in times every week, when students can come in and work on their own entrepreneurial ideas in the space, with a posted university staff with experience in entrepreneurship present during these times to answer any questions that students may have about startups, and provide help on specific issues should students need it. We also wish to enable students to use physical office/home supplies to create their prototypes right in the collider/other space during these times. This will allow students to create a “low-fi” physical prototype and get one step closer to the final product.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left">We would also like to make d.school Stanford-style furniture for this room.</p>
